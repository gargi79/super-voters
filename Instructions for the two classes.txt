Instructions -

Update Candidate form make sure user can add candidte name, party, number, address,description/summary of 
the candidtae. Other extra things you can delete like the id, # of voters  because we are using database.

We should aslo upload picture and save the picture in the code as well.
Also we should be able to display the canditdate information in this app as seen in azure.

Also you can delete the update button but you can work on the remove button where user can delete candidates, 
and from the display they get removed as well. Then we need to save are information so the next 
time I run this in visual studio code, it saves are previous information.

Also you can add Title Like Candidate on the top of the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Voter class should be similar-

But we need to change the code so its setup in and sending data to the Azure database.
we need the first name, middle name, last name, date of birth, phone number. You can delete the voted and voder id, because 
we are using  database. 

Also we should be able to display the voter information in this app as seen in azure.
We also need to work on remove button, to remove the voter, and rather than the update button, make a save button to save the info.

Also you can add Title like Voter on the top of the page.
